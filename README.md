## Task 3D

* Scanner: Use scanner in java to input the censored words and store them in an array
* ArrayList: Add censored words to the ArrayList and then iterate through the string to find if the words in ArrayList match to the words in String.
* List: Same approach as ArrayList but can use List iterator in java to iterate through the list. List will also allow the censored words to be added to a collection.
